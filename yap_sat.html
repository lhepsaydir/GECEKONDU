            <p>The wife sits on this sofa most days to knit things to sell. It is also the space where all cooking and eating is done, as well as hosting the Altin Gunu.
              The Altin Gunu has always been important for the wife - and she continues the tradition which she so loved in the gecekondu in
              the apartment today. In the gecekondu, not just gold was given, but sometimes necessities
              such as oil, flour and sugar.
              The wife received 15 golden bracelets from
              her round at the Altin Gun: to aid in the
              construction of their Yap-Sat.

              the adjacent field. They are nostalgic for their garden where they grew enough to sustain themselves, what they feel was the most important aspect of their
              gecekondu.

              The explosion triggered a landslide that sucked in the neighbouring
